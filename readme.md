### :question: What is *Stealing Ur Feelings?*
[https://stealingurfeelin.gs](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) :arrow_left: :arrow_left: :arrow_left: 

Meet the new AI that knows you better than you know yourself.

[*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) is a deep learning-powered AR experience which analyzes your facial reactions to reveal the dangers of Big Tech's emotional surveillance programs. Using the AI techniques described in corporate patents, [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) learns your deepest secrets just by analyzing your face.

It [won the 2020 Webby Award](https://winners.webbyawards.com/2020/video/immersive-and-mixed-reality/documentary-immersive-and-mixed-reality/126432/stealing-ur-feelings) for Best Immersive Documentary.

The project [premiered on the internet](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/09/23/introducing-stealing-ur-feelings-an-interactive-documentary-about-big-tech-ai-and-you/) on September 23, 2019. 

It world premiered at the [2019 Tribeca Film Festival](https://www.tribecafilm.com/festival/archive/stealing-ur-feelings-2019) and was exhibited at the [Tate Modern](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/tate-exchange/workshop/higher-resolution). It was profiled by the [Museum of the Moving Image](http://www.scienceandfilm.org/articles/3216/stealing-ur-feelings), [*Scientific American*](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/this-video-watches-you-back/), [*Engadget*](https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/02/stealing-ur-feelings-ar-film-facial-recognition-tribeca-2019-kanye-pizza/), [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/stealing-ur-feelings-1.5362954), and many more; it made the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21337863); [MIT selected it for inclusion in DocuBase](https://docubase.mit.edu/project/stealing-ur-feelings/), a curated database of people and projects transforming documentary in the digital age.

[*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) was somewhat notoriously plagiarized by the *Financial Times;* this event was chronicled in an [article for *The American Prospect*](https://prospect.org/culture/stealing-ur-website-emotion-recognition-ai-financial-times/).

The project began life as an application for Mozilla's 2018 [awards for art and advocacy exploring artificial intelligence](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/06/04/mozilla-announces-225000-for-art-and-advocacy-exploring-artificial-intelligence/).

### :eyes: Noah's dev notes
[*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) was built in a hurry, and it shows. [Tech demo v2.0](https://noahlevenson.github.io/stealing-ur-feelings/tech-demo-v2/) was slapped together for the Tribeca Film Festival submission. The [final codebase](https://github.com/noahlevenson/stealing-ur-feelings/tree/master/final) is essentially the result of layering many hasty ideas on top of that demo.

I built a few different computer vision engines to support the idea, including a big complicated custom thing that we didn't end up using. Another thing we didn't use: I managed to compile Dlib for the browser via WebAssembly, and I got its [multithreaded facial landmark detector working with HTML5 canvas](https://github.com/noahlevenson/dlib-in-the-browser) by mapping native pthreads to WebWorkers.

To achieve the seamless quick cuts between video and interactive set pieces, [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) uses a custom system for frame-accurate video synchronization that I originally developed for [*Weird Box*](https://weirdbox.tv); it's based on embedding encoded information in the overscan area of the video, a la [datacasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datacasting).

On Chrome, [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) deploys a zero-copy hack using [OffscreenCanvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas) to run the computer vision engine on a separate thread. At development time, Firefox's implementation of OffscreenCanvas was incomplete. The result is that [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) runs much smoother on Chrome. (Another result is that there have been OffscreenCanvas regressions in Chrome stable releases which have caused [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) to segfault the browser.)

At the Tribeca Film Festival premiere, [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) was installed under a big television hanging from the ceiling which broadcast the AI-extracted "secrets" of whoever was experiencing the project at that moment. The client and server to support this functionality are located in the [/installation](https://github.com/noahlevenson/stealing-ur-feelings/tree/master/final/installation) directory. For the premiere, I tuned the political bias algorithm to classify absolutely everyone as a far-right conservative Republican. It was fun to watch viewers freak out when their secret political affiliation was broadcast on the jumbotron.
